* Overview
Open source intelligence research analyzing how creators monetize their
audiences through link-in-bio platforms and destination pages.

This research informs the development of [[https://bits.page][Bits]], a self-hostable link-in-bio[fn:1]
platform for creators who value platform independence.

* Purpose
We're building tools to help creators own their audience relationships. To build
the right features, we need to understand:

- Which link-in-bio platforms creators currently use
- Where creators direct their audiences (products, services, content)
- How creators structure their monetization (pricing, tiers, platforms)
- What the visual presentation and user experience looks like

This research helps us prioritize features, design better UX, and understand
what integrations matter most.

* Methodology
** Data Collection
1. Curated list of public Instagram profiles across multiple niches:
   - Gaming/streaming
   - Visual arts and design
   - Crafts and woodworking
   - Tech/developer education
   - Food and lifestyle

2. Automated scraping using Babashka and Etaoin (headless browser):
   - Instagram bio and link-in-bio URLs
   - Link-in-bio platform pages (Linktree, Link.me, custom sites)
   - Outbound destination pages (products, services, content)
   - Screenshots at each stage for visual analysis

3. Data stored in EDN format, converted to JSON for SQL analysis via DuckDB

** Analysis
Queries examine:

- Platform usage distribution
- Common destination types (e-commerce, Patreon, courses, etc.)
- Pricing models and tiers
- Link density and funnel complexity

* Ethics and Privacy
** Public Information
All data collected is from publicly accessible profiles and pages. No private
accounts, no authentication circumvention, no personal information beyond what
creators choose to share publicly.

** Intent
This research serves product development for creator-focused tools, not data
resale, advertising, or exploitation. The goal is to build better platforms that
serve creator needs.

** Transparency and Reproducibility
This research is open source. Anyone can:

- Review the methodology (=src/scrape.clj=)
- Run the scraper themselves
- Reproduce the analysis (=analysis.sql=)
- Examine the findings

** Opt-Out
If you are a creator included in this research and wish to have your profile
removed, please email =jcf@bits.page= with:

- Your Instagram handle
- Confirmation that you'd like to be excluded

I will promptly remove your profile from the research dataset and respect your
boundary. No questions asked, no justification required.

* Usage
** Available Tasks
#+begin_src sh :results output verbatim
just --list
#+end_src

#+results:
: Available recipes:
:     all     # Full pipeline: scrape, convert, analyze
:     analyze # Run DuckDB analysis
:     convert # Convert EDN to JSON for analysis
:     default
:     scrape  # Scrape Instagram profiles

** Prerequisites
- Babashka
- DuckDB
- Firefox with geckodriver
- Instagram cookies (for authenticated discovery of creator's bits)

** Configuration
Edit =config.edn= to adjust scraper behavior:

#+begin_src clojure
{:data-dir      "./data"
 :browser       :firefox
 :headless      true
 :rate-limit-ms 2000}
#+end_src

** Running the Scraper
Scrape all profiles in profiles.edn:

#+begin_src sh
just scrape
#+end_src

Scrape a single profile:

#+begin_src sh
bb src/scrape.clj https://www.instagram.com/username/
#+end_src

** Analysis Pipeline
#+begin_example
TODO Just use JSON
#+end_example

Convert EDN to JSON and run analysis:

#+begin_src sh
just analyze
#+end_src

Run the full pipeline:

#+begin_src sh
just all
#+end_src

* Findings
Analysis reveals:

- Platform usage patterns (52% Instagram cross-links, 31% Threads, 9% Linktree)
- Creator monetization strategies by niche
- Pricing models and subscription tiers
- Visual design patterns on destination pages

Results inform feature prioritization and product direction for Bits.

Research methodology (code) is open source. Scraped data is for internal product
development and academic research purposes.

* Footnotes
[fn:1] This is an oversimplification in the long term as the mission is to
empower creative individuals to connect with their audiences and make money
doing something meaningful. In the short term (as of right now) I'm being
generous. This will change.
