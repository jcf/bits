* Development
I would recommend installing [[https://devenv.sh][=devenv=]] to simplify setting up a working
development environment. With =devenv= installed, one can spin up a development
environment with a single command:

#+begin_src sh :eval never
devenv up
#+end_src

As we make use of the =invetica.dev= domain during development and generate
self-signed SSL certificates via =mkcert=, you'll want to run =just setup= the
first time you fire things up.

With a running development environment, one has access to the following:

1. [[https://land.invetica.dev][land.invetica.dev]]: Landing page where people can find out more about Bits.
1. [[https://edit.invetica.dev/][edit.invetica.dev]]: Admin panel for customizing your page.
2. [[https://*.page.invetica.dev/][*.page.invetica.dev]]: The Bits experience.
