title: Welcome to Bits
---

Hi, welcome to **Bits**. This is the beginning of an open-source product
designed to enable creative individuals to cultivate lasting, profitable
relationships with an engaged audience.

## What makes this different?

Platforms already exist for publishing content, sponsoring your work, and
connecting with your fans. The companies behind those platforms have invested
billions in maximizing engagement and rent us workers a patch of land in
exchange for a share of the crops.

Unfortunately, those same lords often evict their tenants leaving us with no
means of reaching our audience.

Bits is different in two ways:

1. We're not funded by institutional investors who demand hockey-stick growth
2. Our users own the means of production

That's right -- you always have the option to take your data and run your own
version of Bits on a computer of your choosing.

<summary>🙈 For the computer whiz kids</summary>

We've architected Bits in such a way that you can run it yourself, if you want
to. And it will be as simple as:

``` console
$ curl --follow https://downloads.usebits.app/server/latest.zip | unzip
```

Followed by a `./bits serve`.

## Where does the money come from?

You can pay us to run things for you. You can either use one of our hosted
pages, bring your own custom domain, or run everything yourself (with help from
any individual or team you choose).

If you're creativity consists of consensual acts that we can legally host in our
available jurisdictions, we hope you'll choose us to host your Bits.

## Call to action

import BitsLink from '@/components/BitsLink.astro';

If you're interested in following along as I take this from zero to one, you can
follow me over on <BitsLink sub="jcf">my Bits page</BitsLink>, or [drop me an
email](mailto:jcf@usebits.app).
