#+title:  Mission over SaaS startup playbook

Bits isn't a SaaS business where a exhaustively-documented closed source product
development process driven by demos and customer interviews trumps all.

We are building infrastructure for a more egalitarian society. Throughout
history, ruling elites have captured power—pharaohs, emperors, despots.
Technology promised liberation, but a nepotistic leisure class of
Harvard-educated tech billionaires has captured that value instead.

Bits empowers everyone equally by placing transformative technology in the hands
of the majority. Much like Signal, Wordpress of old, and Linux we aim to make it
trivial for individuals to connect, exchange goods and services, and to do so
without minoritarian interference.

This mission brings a clarity to our approach. Accessibility and censorship
resistance are paramount. Ease of use and flexible deployment options are
pivotal.

What does this mean in practice?

* Single binary written in Rust
Python, Ruby, and JVM-based languages all suffer from the same deployment
complexity whereby disparate files and arcane executables come together via
POSIX paths, ecosystem-specific load paths and classpaths, and custom package
managers.

Projects like =uv= aim to save us from Python dependency hell. Bundler made
working with Ruby less painful. Clojure has Leiningen, Boot, and tools.deps. All
of this incidental complexity is overwhelming and unnecessary.

Rust cannot sidestep the complexity of compilation, and is woefully inadequate
relative to any Lisp with REPL-driven development, but my productivity and needs
must come second to the experience of the community I hope to build.

Running Bits for yourself should be as simple as:

#+begin_src sh :results output verbatim
./bits serve --port 3142
#+end_src

* SvelteKit client baked into the single binary
App Stores limit distribution relative to web browsers, and impose extreme
financial duress versus direct payment. The prevalence of browsers and HTTP make
it an obvious choice for connecting a globally-distributed community.

Unfortunately, modern browsers building on top of the combination of HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, and other multimedia benefit from the use of build tools such as
Vite.

Having built web applications at a time when jQuery didn't exist, I am acutely
aware that reactivity, state management, and excellent user experiences require
abstraction to be practical.

I will avoid a lengthy comparison of frameworks and technologies here. SvelteKit
is highly efficient, well established, and effective at delivering such
experiences.

* PostgreSQL for persistent state
PostgreSQL is open source, widely supported (cPanel, Neon, cloud providers), and
eliminates the SQLite → PostgreSQL migration pain that plagues self-hosted tools
like Gitea.

For those unable or unwilling to manage PostgreSQL themselves, hosted instances
will be available. For those who can, sovereignty through self-hosting is
straightforward.

* Self-hosting with optional infrastructure acceleration
We find ourselves in a world of tech titans and gargantuan platforms that herd
the masses like the tax cattle of old. These established institutions leveraged
carefully can accelerate our progress. Think of the vine that ascends the tree
to reach sunlight faster than any other.

Bits runs anywhere: =./bits serve= on your hardware, or use existing
infrastructure like Cloudflare, Hetzner, or cPanel to accelerate deployment.

We build for the tree, but offer vines to those who want them.

* Moderation and signal management
Individuals control their experience. Instance operators set policies for their
communities. We provide tools, not mandates.

During my time working on social networks with content creators I worked on
applying human social circles to audience cultivation. One's inner circle are
most trusted, and one might permit those people to populate a feed or inbox.
Over time, examples of behaviour justify either pulling or pushing someone
closer. This geometric idea of scoring users with boundary conditions is
something we'll explore in more detail.

* Ethics
I want to make clear my personal position on what is acceptable and what is not.

Firstly, I am an anarchist. What that means to me is I have zero respect for
institutions. I respect individuals, I respect nature, I respect the laws of our
objective reality. I consider companies, churches, countries, castes, and
governments to be nothing more than man-made inventions that all too often
undermine humanism and subject people to entirely avoidable kafkaesque
experiences. I've lost count of the number of times I've heard someone excuse
abhorrent behaviour by saying "it's in the company's best interest".

I believe we are all entitled to our own beliefs, but that our beliefs are not
sacred and should stand up to criticism. My aforementioned beliefs regarding
companies are loosely held and open to challenge.

Informed consent and mutual respect. There's a time and place to challenge one
another. If you publish an opinion, you invite a response. If you want quiet,
you must be silent yourself. We may all shout into the void. I want to build
tools to help surface signal and manage the noise.

Only through curiosity and kindness can we understand one another and progress
as a species.

If I build Bits correctly, I cannot stop unethical actors from using Bits. In
much the same way locks on doors, encrypted messages, and anonymous online
accounts enable unethical behaviour, people with different values to my own
could use the technology I am building to do things I would consider deplorable.

I cannot know that my ethics are objectively valid. I believe the categorical
imperative makes sense. I believe informed consent inhibits abuse. I believe
abuse is bad. It is apparent the universe itself allows for any such behaviour
and others may disagree with what I consider to be right.

I also believe humans are fundamentally good. We are capable of great acts of
kindness and creativity. We are the universe experiencing itself -- a beautiful
inevitability of a stochastic set of natural laws that counteract the pervasive
progress towards higher entropy. We build sandcastles knowing the world will
erase them, making way for the next generation to leave their mark.

I hope my contributions through Bits will empower a great number of people to
manifest wonderful creations and share them with the world.

In practice, this means:

- Export/import of all data to enable true portability
- Custom domain support so your identity survives platform changes
- Open APIs enabling alternative clients and integrations
- Transparent policies: instance operators state their rules, users choose
  accordingly
