# Build

Yesterday, we worked towards a prompt created by Claude. This prompt alluded to
the desired outcome but took us in a direction where we wasted hours building an
entirely different product that ticks absolutely none of the boxes required to
build a decentralized, E2EE marketplace.

For this project to work, operators need to run their own nodes with monetary
incentives. That means trivial to deploy (i.e. single binary with minimal/zero
external dependencies). We need to decentralize storage rather than outsourcing
it to hyperscalers like AWS. Authentication must rely on cryptography and
decentralized IDs.

There is absolutely no point in blindly applying SF/VC mentality to building a
technologically significant product that aims to democratize information and
enable a more socialist internet where the means of production is in the hands
of the many rather than the few.

Let's start over. We need a Rust server that depends only on a blockchain,
file/blob storage and optionally SQLite for wholly local, structured
data (e.g. configuration, tracking, etc. that needs to persist restarts).

Every decentralized identity should live on chain so we can replicate across the
network. We should avoid storing large amounts of information on chain to keep
size down.

Anonymity is critical.

The authors of this project should receive a small percentage of all
transactions to support continued development. Contributors who host encrypted
blobs, transfer data via a bittorrent swarm, and create content also deserve a
cut. People should pay to use the network. Exact percentages need to be
configurable when the network starts up.

Projects like FileCoin, I2P, Ethereum should serve as inspiration. We should
leverge libraries/frameworks like Foundry where it makes sense.

This project needs to bring innovative technology to the masses by providing
less-technical users (e.g. content creators) with working software as easy to
use as OnlyFans, Discord, or YouTube.

This is a technosocialism movement.
